    question: "What is Chronify?",
    answer:
      "Chronify is a platform that builds trust by creating a transparent and verifiable history for products. It allows everyone, from the brand that made the item to the person buying it, to see its entire journey and confirm that it's authentic.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Chronify prove a product is authentic?",
    answer:
      "Each product gets a unique, unforgeable digital identity—like a 'digital passport'—when it's created. Every step of its journey is permanently recorded in this passport. Because this history can't be faked or changed, it provides absolute proof of the product's origin and authenticity.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why did you build Chronify on Hedera?",
    answer:
      "We chose Hedera because it's extremely fast, secure, and has very low, predictable fees. This allows us to record every step of a product's journey almost instantly and affordably, making it practical for real-world business use.",
  },
  {
    question: "What makes Chronify different from other tracking systems?",
    answer:
      "Our core advantage is our 'future-proof' design. Chronify is built to be highly flexible, allowing us to add new features or upgrade the system easily without any downtime. This means we can quickly adapt to new challenges in the supply chain industry.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is Chronify for?",
    answer:
      "Chronify is for everyone in the supply chain! It's for manufacturers protecting their brand, distributors tracking inventory, retailers assuring quality, and most importantly, for consumers who deserve to know the true story behind the products they buy.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be a tech expert to use this?",
    answer:
      "Not at all. We've designed Chronify to be very user-friendly. If you're a consumer, all you need to do is scan a QR code with your phone. Our interface for business partners is just as simple and intuitive.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does a product get its 'Digital Passport'?",
    answer:
      "Once a manufacturer is verified on our platform, a unique Digital Passport is automatically created the moment they register a new product in the system. This passport is then linked to the physical item, ready to start its journey.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data and the product's history secure?",
    answer:
      "Yes, completely. By using the Hedera network, every piece of information is locked in with powerful cryptography. Once a step in the journey is recorded, it can never be altered or deleted by anyone, guaranteeing a secure and trustworthy history.",
